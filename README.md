My name is Ã‰rick Lopes. I've been working as Back-End Developer since 2018 and currently I'm a Software Developer at Avenue Code.
Iâ€™m currently learning about React.js and Front-end technologies. So I've created a Youtube Channel called Dev<&>Tal where I produce and share content.


would you like reach me?
